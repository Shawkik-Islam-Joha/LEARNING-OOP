    "\n",
    "Inheritance in C++ is a fundamental object-oriented programming (OOP) concept that allows a class (called a derived or child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (data members and member functions) from another class (called a base or parent class). It promotes code reusability, establishes a relationship between classes, and enables polymorphism. Let me break it down step-by-step:\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts of Inheritance\n",
    "1. **Base Class (Parent Class)**: The class whose properties and methods are inherited by another class.\n",
    "2. **Derived Class (Child Class)**: The class that inherits from the base class and can add its own properties or override inherited ones.\n",
    "3. **Syntax**:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "class Base {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    // Base class members\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "class Derived : access_specifier Base {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    // Derived class members\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `access_specifier` can be `public`, `private`, or `protected`. It determines how the inherited members are accessible in the derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Inheritance\n",
    "1. **Single Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from one base class.\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "class Animal {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void eat() { cout << \"Eating...\\n\"; }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog : public Animal {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void bark() { cout << \"Barking...\\n\"; }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "    Dog d;\n",
    "    d.eat();  // Inherited from Animal\n",
    "    d.bark(); // Defined in Dog\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Inheritance**: A derived class inherits from more than one base class.\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "class Father {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void height() { cout << \"Tall\\n\"; }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "class Mother {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void hair() { cout << \"Curly\\n\"; }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child : public Father, public Mother {\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "    Child c;\n",
    "    c.height(); // From Father\n",
    "    c.hair();   // From Mother\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A class is derived from a class that is itself derived from another class (a chain of inheritance).\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "class Animal {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void eat() { cout << \"Eating...\\n\"; }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "class Mammal : public Animal {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void walk() { cout << \"Walking...\\n\"; }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog : public Mammal {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void bark() { cout << \"Barking...\\n\"; }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "    Dog d;\n",
    "    d.eat();  // From Animal\n",
    "    d.walk(); // From Mammal\n",
    "    d.bark(); // From Dog\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "class Vehicle {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void start() { cout << \"Starting...\\n\"; }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car : public Vehicle {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void drive() { cout << \"Driving...\\n\"; }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "class Bike : public Vehicle {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void ride() { cout << \"Riding...\\n\"; }\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of two or more types of inheritance (e.g., multiple and multilevel). This can lead to the \"diamond problem\" (explained later).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access Specifiers\n",
    "- **`public`**: Inherited members retain their original access level (public remains public, protected remains protected).\n",
    "- **`protected`**: Public and protected members of the base class become protected in the derived class.\n",
    "- **`private`**: All members of the base class become private in the derived class (rarely used).\n",
    "\n",
    "| Base Class Access | Public Inheritance | Protected Inheritance | Private Inheritance |\n",
    "|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n",
    "| Public            | Public            | Protected             | Private             |\n",
    "| Protected         | Protected         | Protected             | Private             |\n",
    "| Private           | Not accessible    | Not accessible        | Not accessible      |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Diamond Problem\n",
    "In multiple inheritance, if a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common base class, ambiguity arises. This is called the diamond problem.\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "class A {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void show() { cout << \"Class A\\n\"; }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "class B : public A {};\n",
    "class C : public A {};\n",
    "class D : public B, public C {};\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "    D d;\n",
    "    d.show(); // Error: Ambiguous call to show()\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Solution**: Use the `virtual` keyword to ensure only one copy of the base class is inherited.\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "class A {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void show() { cout << \"Class A\\n\"; }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "class B : virtual public A {};\n",
    "class C : virtual public A {};\n",
    "class D : public B, public C {};\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "    D d;\n",
    "    d.show(); // Works fine now\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "1. **Constructor and Destructor Order**:\n",
    "   - Constructors are called from base to derived.\n",
    "   - Destructors are called from derived to base.\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "class Base {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    Base() { cout << \"Base Constructor\\n\"; }\n",
    "    ~Base() { cout << \"Base Destructor\\n\"; }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "class Derived : public Base {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    Derived() { cout << \"Derived Constructor\\n\"; }\n",
    "    ~Derived() { cout << \"Derived Destructor\\n\"; }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "    Derived d;\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Output:\n",
    "// Base Constructor\n",
    "// Derived Constructor\n",
    "// Derived Destructor\n",
    "// Base Destructor\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Overriding**: A derived class can redefine a base class function.\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "class Animal {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void sound() { cout << \"Some sound\\n\"; }\n",
    "};\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog : public Animal {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void sound() { cout << \"Woof\\n\"; }\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Accessing Base Class Members**: Use the scope resolution operator (`::`) if needed.\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "class Dog : public Animal {\n",
    "public:\n",
    "    void makeSound() {\n",
    "        Animal::sound(); // Calls base class version\n",
    "    }\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Inheritance\n",
    "- **Code Reusability**: Avoid rewriting common code.\n",
    "- **Extensibility**: Easily extend functionality.\n",
    "- **Polymorphism**: Use base class pointers/references to work with derived class objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- Tight coupling between classes.\n",
    "- Complexity increases with multiple or hybrid inheritance.\n",
